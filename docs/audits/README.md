### Usage Guidelines

- Treat these documents as **immutable records**. If you must add context, append an "Addendum" section with the date and author.
- When new audits are produced, add the deliverables here and update the table above.
- Summaries intended for ongoing work should also be mirrored in `docs/project-status/` so they feed into sprint planning.
