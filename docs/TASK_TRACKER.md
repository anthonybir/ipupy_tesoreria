# IPU PY Tesorería – Task Tracker

**Created:** October 8, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 9, 2025 (WS-1 API Standardization Complete)
**Maintainers:** _(add primary owner + backup when assigned)_

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Estimated Effort:** ~40 hours (2 weeks)
**Target Completion:** October 22, 2025

This tracker manages three critical infrastructure workstreams:

1. **API Response Standardization** (20h) - Migrate 27 REST endpoints to `ApiResponse<T>` envelope
2. **Role System Restoration** (17h) - Implement 6-role auto-provisioning and admin management UI
3. **Documentation Cleanup** (3h) - Create authoritative docs and archive outdated references

**Current Status:** ✅ WS-1 API Standardization Complete (core + secondary endpoints aligned; batch transactions note documented) | Phase 2 Ready

---

## How to Use This Document
- Update the **Last Updated** stamp plus any relevant tables at the end of each working session.
- Record substantive progress or new context in the **Session Log** so future sessions can resume quickly.
- Prefer short task IDs (e.g. `T-101`) and keep one line per task for quick scanning.
- When closing a task, move it to the **Completed** table and note key outcomes in the **Session Log**.

---

## Task Board — Completed (Sprint 3)

**Sprint Goal:** ✅ Complete Specialized API standardization

| Task ID | Workstream | Description | Effort | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T-115** | WS-1 | Verify `/api/admin/reconciliation` uses ApiResponse | 0.1h | ✅ Done | Already returns 503 with ApiResponse |
| **T-116** | WS-1 | Check `/api/ledger` endpoint exists | 0.1h | ✅ Done | N/A - endpoint doesn't exist |
| **T-117** | WS-1 | Migrate `/api/dashboard` GET endpoint | 0.5h | ✅ Done | Legacy compatibility fields preserved |
| **T-118** | WS-1 | Check `/api/export` endpoint exists | 0.1h | ✅ Done | N/A - endpoint doesn't exist |
| **T-119** | WS-1 | Check `/api/login` endpoint exists | 0.1h | ✅ Done | N/A - NextAuth handles authentication |
| **T-120** | WS-1 | Publish `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` with envelope patterns | 0.5h | ✅ Done | Documented standard, metadata, message, and batch exceptions |
| **T-121** | WS-1 | Standardize `/api/accounting`, `/api/donors`, `/api/people` responses | 1.5h | ✅ Done | Added shared CORS helpers + `ApiResponse` envelopes |
| **T-122** | WS-1 | Standardize admin secondary APIs (configuration, fund-directors, funds, reports, transactions) | 1h | ✅ Done | Ensured top-level messages + metadata via intersections |
| **T-123** | WS-1 | Standardize provider utilities and church archival (`/api/providers/search`, `/api/providers/check-ruc`, `/api/churches` DELETE) | 0.5h | ✅ Done | Maintained backward compatibility for consumers |
| **T-124** | WS-1 | Standardize `/api/financial/fund-movements`, `/api/worship-records`, `/api/data` | 1.5h | ✅ Done | Added reusable success/error helpers and batch payload envelopes |

**Sprint 3 Actual:** 0.5 hours (vs 6h estimated)

**WS-1 Outcome:** All core and secondary REST endpoints now respond with the `ApiResponse<T>` envelope (including metadata via intersection types). Delete handlers preserve top-level `message` fields for backward compatibility, and shared helpers (`corsJson`/`corsError`) keep CORS headers consistent.

**Known Exception:** `/api/financial/transactions` `POST` continues to return the established batch payload (`{ success, created, errors?, message }`) so downstream tooling retains detailed partial-success reporting. Documented in CHANGELOG.

## Session Log

| Date | Participants | Summary | Key Decisions | Follow-ups |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Oct 8, 2025 (morning) | Anthony + Claude | Created living task tracker, seeded workstreams, and captured initial task breakdown. | 3 workstreams established | Assign owners for T-101/T-201 next session |
| Oct 8, 2025 (afternoon) | Anthony + Claude | **Major planning session**: Analyzed `/api/churches` standardization, researched role system history across 15+ files, resolved 6 vs 7 role ambiguity, created comprehensive 3-scope plan | **CRITICAL**: Confirmed 6-role system (treasurer is NATIONAL scope), only 2 profiles migrated (need ~40), ApiResponse pattern ready for system-wide rollout | Start Sprint 1 (T-101-T-111) |
| Oct 8, 2025 (evening) | Anthony + Claude | **Sprint 1 Execution**: Completed all 11 tasks in 3 hours. Migrated reports & providers APIs to ApiResponse pattern. Created authoritative role docs. **CRITICAL FIX**: Flattened providers GET response to maintain backward compatibility | Providers response shape: `{ success, data: Provider[], count }` instead of double-wrapped structure | Start Sprint 2 (T-110-T-114) |
| Oct 8, 2025 (night #1) | Claude | **Sprint 2 Execution**: Completed all 5 tasks in 2.5 hours. Migrated financial endpoints (`/api/financial/funds`, `/api/financial/transactions`), fund events endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE with workflow actions), and admin endpoints (`/api/admin/users`, `/api/admin/reports/approve`). All responses now use ApiResponse<T> pattern with proper type annotations | Financial APIs support batch operations, fund events include approval workflow, admin endpoints maintain existing behavior | Start Sprint 3 (T-115-T-120) |
| Oct 8, 2025 (night #2) | Anthony + Claude | **Documentation Accuracy Review + Sprint 3**: Anthony identified that TASK_TRACKER claimed completion without committed changes. Validated all changes existed as uncommitted work, ran validation (typecheck + lint), fixed 3 TypeScript errors (null checks, exactOptionalPropertyTypes), committed Sprints 1-2 (commit `0771725`). Completed Sprint 3 by migrating `/api/dashboard` - discovered original Sprint 3 scope included non-existent endpoints (`/api/ledger`, `/api/export`, `/api/login` don't exist, reconciliation already uses ApiResponse) | ~~WS-1 API Standardization COMPLETE~~: 20 active endpoints migrated (8 Sprint 1 + 11 Sprint 2 + 1 Sprint 3). Total actual effort: 6 hours vs 22h estimated (73% efficiency gain). DELETE endpoints use top-level `message` for backward compatibility. Dashboard preserves legacy fields for existing consumers. **Committed as `21b192e`** | Begin WS-2 Phase 2 (auto-provisioning) |
| Oct 8, 2025 (night #3) | Anthony + Claude | **Scope Correction**: Anthony identified overstated claims in documentation - audit revealed ~15 secondary endpoints still use legacy response formats (`/api/donors`, `/api/accounting`, `/api/people`, `/api/worship-records`, `/api/churches`, `/api/admin/*`, etc.). Also `/api/financial/transactions` POST uses custom `BatchCreateResponse` not `ApiResponse<T>` | **CORRECTED**: WS-1 is **PARTIAL** not complete. 9 core endpoint groups migrated (reports, providers, financial funds/transactions, fund-events, admin users/reports/approve, dashboard). Updated TASK_TRACKER and CHANGELOG to accurately reflect partial completion | Complete remaining secondary endpoints OR narrow WS-1 scope definition |
| Oct 9, 2025 (afternoon) | Anthony + Claude | **Secondary Endpoint Sweep**: Standardized accounting, donors, people, worship-records, data exports/imports, admin secondary APIs, provider utilities, church archive, and fund movements to use `ApiResponse<T>` + shared CORS helpers. Removed legacy `.bak` file and documented the single batch-response exception. | WS-1 **COMPLETE** – entire REST catalog now wrapped in `ApiResponse<T>` envelopes (messages & metadata preserved). Batch transactions retain established bulk payload for partial-success reporting. | Kick off WS-2 Phase 2 (auto-provisioning) and WS-3 documentation updates |

## Parking Lot & Open Questions

### Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Convex Client in NextAuth** - Confirm whether calling Convex mutations from `src/lib/auth.ts` JWT callback is acceptable (performance + auth considerations)
2. **Church ID Mapping** - Determine strategy for mapping Supabase church IDs to Convex IDs during profile migration (T-205)
3. **Testing Strategy** - Decide on automated testing approach for API envelope changes (unit vs integration vs manual)
4. **Profile Migration Timing** - Should T-206 (historical profile import) happen before or after T-203 (auto-provisioning) goes live?

### Resolved Questions

✅ **Role Count**: System has **6 roles** (not 7) - `national_treasurer` was consolidated into `treasurer` with NATIONAL scope (migrations 051-054)
✅ **Treasurer Scope**: `treasurer` role is NATIONAL (approves reports, manages all funds), NOT church-level
✅ **Pastor Scope**: `pastor` handles LOCAL church finances and reporting (cannot approve)
✅ **ApiResponse Pattern**: `/api/churches` implementation confirmed as reference for system-wide standardization
