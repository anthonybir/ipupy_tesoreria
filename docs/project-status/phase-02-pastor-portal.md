# Phase 2 – Pastor Portal Rollout

## ✅ Delivered
- Added a four-step online submission wizard in `public/church-accounting.html` covering period setup, income breakdown, expense/deposit details, and review.
- Persisted submissions via `POST /api/reports` with church-scoped access control, automatic totals, and support for inline photo uploads (summary + deposit slips) saved under `uploads/`.
- Recorded submission metadata (`submission_type`, `submitted_by`, `submitted_at`) plus status change history and email notification queue entries through the new `report_status_history` and `report_notifications` tables (`migrations/008_reports_portal_enhancement.sql`).
- Enforced audit attribution using the `setAuditContext` helper so every API call tags the actor into PostgreSQL session context.

## 📄 Key Files
- `public/church-accounting.html`
- `api/reports.js`
- `migrations/008_reports_portal_enhancement.sql`

## 🧪 Validation Notes
- Manual wizard walkthrough (all four steps, attachments with base64 preview) then confirmed the new fields persisted by querying `/api/reports`.
- Ran `npm run check` to ensure server entrypoint still parses.

## 🔍 Follow-Up Opportunities
- Automate email delivery for queued notifications (`report_notifications.status = 'pending'`).
- Surface validation messages inline (currently using toast/alert fallback).
- Add offline sync integration so the wizard can prefill from local IndexedDB drafts.
