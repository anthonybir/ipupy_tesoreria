### Usage Guidelines

- **Active plans** (🟡) should be reviewed in sprint planning and updated when milestones shift.
- **Historical docs** (🕒) stay for traceability; do not modify retroactively—append an “Addendum” section if new context is required.
- When creating a new status doc, add it to this table and clearly mark the status badge in the document header.

For long-range ideas that have not entered execution, prefer [`docs/future-improvements/`](../future-improvements/README.md).
