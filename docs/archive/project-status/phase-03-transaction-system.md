# Phase 3 – Transaction System Upgrade

## ✅ Delivered
- Enhanced the treasurer modal (`public/index.html`) to support batching multiple transaction line-items before submission, complete with inline validation and removable queue.
- Extended `api/financial.js` to accept `entries[]` payloads, wrap inserts inside a single transaction, re-balance funds per row, and expose `id` query parameters for edit/delete calls.
- Added UI hooks for editing/deleting individual ledger entries using the new API signature and ensured fund balances refresh automatically after batch commit.
- Wired audit context so every national transaction insert/update/delete is recorded by the new audit triggers.

## 📄 Key Files
- `public/index.html`
- `api/financial.js`

## 🧪 Validation Notes
- Manually batched entries (mixed income/expense) and confirmed fund balances update instantly and appear in the transaction table.
- Used `npm run check` after refactor (shared with phase 2).

## 🔍 Follow-Up Opportunities
- Add inline editing for queued entries before batch submission.
- Expose CSV export for transaction batches (currently only individual exports exist).
- Implement pagination/virtual scrolling when transaction volume is large.
