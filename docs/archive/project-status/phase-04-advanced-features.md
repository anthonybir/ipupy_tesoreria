# Phase 4 – Advanced Features

## ✅ Delivered
- Added treasurer-facing status controls: report lists now display timestamps, color-coded chips, and a one-click "Procesar" action that stamps `processed_by`/`processed_at`, records a history entry, and queues a notification (`api/reports.js`, `public/index.html`).
- Extended the dashboard payload (`api/dashboard.js`) with fund balances, report status counts, and a trailing 12-month summary to drive richer analytics cards.
- Introduced a minimal audit schema (`migrations/009_audit_log.sql`) with triggers on `reports` and `transactions`, plus helpers that stamp the acting email via PostgreSQL session config.
- Stored photo attachments for both summary sheets and deposit slips, with resilient filesystem handling and graceful fallbacks when storage fails.

## 📄 Key Files
- `api/reports.js`
- `api/dashboard.js`
- `public/index.html`
- `migrations/009_audit_log.sql`

## 🧪 Validation Notes
- Manual workflow: submitted report → processed via treasurer UI → verified status history auditors log, dashboard aggregates, and queued notifications.
- `npm run check` (shared across current iteration).

## 🔍 Follow-Up Opportunities
- Build analytic widgets in the client to consume the new dashboard aggregates.
- Add UI for reviewing the audit log and report history entries.
- Configure storage lifecycle for `/uploads/` (archival/cleanup or offload to object storage).
