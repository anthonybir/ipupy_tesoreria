# Treasurer Role Consolidation - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Impact**: Role system simplification (6 roles → 5 roles)

---

## What Changed

The system previously had two separate treasurer roles:
- `treasurer` - Church-level financial operations
- `national_treasurer` - National-level fund management

**Problem**: This created confusion because the actual organizational structure only has ONE treasurer position (a nationally elected role).

**Solution**: Merged both roles into a single `treasurer` role with national-level permissions.

---

## Why This Change Was Necessary

**User Clarification** (2025-10-06):
> "The treasurer is a NATIONALLY scoped role, sitting JUST below the admin. Pastors handle ALL local church operations including finances."

The original role system was based on an incorrect assumption about organizational structure. This consolidation aligns the software with actual church governance.
