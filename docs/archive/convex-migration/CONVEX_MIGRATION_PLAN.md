---

## ✅ Phase 3: Core Queries Migration (COMPLETE)

**Duration**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-01-07
**Completed**: 2025-01-07

### Overview

Migrate core database operations from Supabase queries to Convex functions. This phase focused on creating reusable query and mutation patterns that will be used by API routes and frontend hooks.

**Result**: ✅ All 7 modules successfully migrated to Convex with full CRUD operations, authorization, and business logic validation.

### Architecture Pattern

```typescript
// Before (Supabase)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('churches')
  .select('*')
  .eq('active', true)
  .order('name');

// After (Convex)
const churches = await ctx.db
  .query("churches")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("active"), true))
  .collect();
```

5. Compare results with Supabase for consistency

---

## ✅ Phase 4: API Routes Migration (COMPLETE)

**Duration**: 12-16 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-01-07
**Completed**: 2025-10-08

### Overview

Replace Supabase-based API routes with Convex function calls. This phase focuses on maintaining the same API contracts while switching the backend implementation.

### Migration Strategy

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before (Supabase API Route)
// src/app/api/churches/route.ts
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const auth = await getAuthFromCookies();
  const result = await executeWithContext(auth, async (client) => {
    return await client.query('SELECT * FROM churches');
  });
  return NextResponse.json(result.rows);
}

// After (Convex + API Route Bridge)
// src/app/api/churches/route.ts
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const churches = await convexClient.query(api.churches.list);
  return NextResponse.json(churches);
}
```

### Final Blockers Resolved (2025-10-08)

- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/*` routes now proxy every action through Convex mutations/queries (no Supabase client imports remain).
- ✅ Fund events stack (`/api/fund-events` + detail/budget/actual subroutes) returns the legacy Supabase contract while sourcing data from Convex.
- ✅ All remaining handlers that referenced `@/lib/auth-supabase` were refactored to use the NextAuth + Convex bridge.

With these migrations in place the route layer is fully Convex-backed, matching the legacy REST contracts expected by the React hooks.

### 4.1 Setup Convex Client + NextAuth OIDC Bridge (2h) ✅

**MAJOR PIVOT**: Replaced Supabase Auth JWT approach with NextAuth v5 → Convex OIDC bridge (Option B from auth analysis).

**Why the change**: Supabase JWTs don't match Convex OIDC requirements. NextAuth provides proper Google OIDC tokens that Convex can validate.

- [x] Install NextAuth.js v5 (`next-auth@beta`) for Next.js 15 compatibility
- [x] Create NextAuth configuration ([src/lib/auth.ts](../src/lib/auth.ts))
  - [x] Google OAuth provider with offline access (for refresh tokens)
  - [x] Domain validation (`@ipupy.org.py`) in signIn callback
  - [x] JWT session strategy (serverless-compatible)
  - [x] Token refresh logic using Google OAuth token endpoint
  - [x] Store id_token, access_token, refresh_token in encrypted JWT
- [x] Create NextAuth API route handler ([src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts](../src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts))
- [x] Create OpenID endpoints for Convex
  - [x] `/api/openid/token` - Fetch current Google ID token from NextAuth session
  - [x] `/api/openid/refresh` - Force token refresh when needed
- [x] Configure Convex auth.config.ts for Google OIDC
  - [x] Set `domain: "https://accounts.google.com"` (matches `iss` claim)
  - [x] Set `applicationID: NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (matches `aud` claim)
- [x] Create useAuthFromNextAuth hook ([src/hooks/useAuthFromNextAuth.ts](../src/hooks/useAuthFromNextAuth.ts))
  - [x] Implements Convex `useAuth` interface
  - [x] Fetches ID tokens from NextAuth via `/api/openid/token`
  - [x] Handles automatic token refresh
- [x] Update root providers ([src/app/providers.tsx](../src/app/providers.tsx))
  - [x] Add SessionProvider from NextAuth
  - [x] Replace ConvexProvider with ConvexProviderWithAuth
  - [x] Wire useAuthFromNextAuth hook
- [x] Create server-side Convex client ([src/lib/convex-server.ts](../src/lib/convex-server.ts))
  - [x] `getAuthenticatedConvexClient()` - Per-request client with Google ID token
  - [x] Throws `AuthenticationError` for proper 401 responses
  - [x] Uses NextAuth `auth()` instead of Supabase
- [x] Migrate provider routes to use authenticated client (Phase 4.6)
  - [x] `src/app/api/providers/route.ts` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - [x] `src/app/api/providers/search/route.ts` (GET)
  - [x] `src/app/api/providers/check-ruc/route.ts` (GET)
- [x] Update environment variables ([.env.example](../.env.example))
  - [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - For both NextAuth and Convex
  - [x] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - For NextAuth server
  - [x] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT encryption key
  - [x] `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Base URL for callbacks
  - [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment URL
- [x] Fix all TypeScript errors (exactOptionalPropertyTypes compliance)
- [x] Fix auth error handling (AuthenticationError → 401 instead of 500)
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
  - [x] [PHASE_4.1b_NEXTAUTH_OIDC_COMPLETE.md](../docs/PHASE_4.1b_NEXTAUTH_OIDC_COMPLETE.md)
  - [x] [AUTH_ERROR_HANDLING.md](../docs/AUTH_ERROR_HANDLING.md)

**Result**: Full NextAuth → Convex OIDC integration complete. All client-side and server-side auth now flows through Google OIDC tokens validated by Convex. Provider routes migrated and tested.

### 4.2 Church Routes (1.5h) ✅

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/churches/route.ts`
  - [x] GET - List churches → `api.churches.list`
  - [x] POST - Create church → `api.churches.create` (with legacy primaryPastor support)
  - [x] PUT - Update church → `api.churches.update` (with legacy primaryPastor support)
  - [x] DELETE - Archive church → `api.churches.archive` (soft delete)
- [x] Simplify from Supabase version (removed complex pastor table JOIN)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (no errors)
- [x] Use getAuthenticatedConvexClient() for all requests
- [x] Proper error handling via AuthenticationError

**Result**: Church routes migrated successfully. Simplified from Supabase's complex pastor management (separate `pastors` table + `church_primary_pastors` view) to inline pastor fields on churches table. Legacy `primaryPastor` object API maintained for backward compatibility.

### 4.3 Report Routes (3h) ✅

**SIMPLIFIED MIGRATION**: Core functionality implemented, advanced features deferred to later phases.

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/reports/route.ts` (simplified from 1249 → 437 lines, 65% reduction)
  - [x] GET - List reports → `api.reports.list` (with filters: churchId, year, month)
  - [x] GET with `last_report=true` - Special query for most recent report
  - [x] POST - Create report → `api.reports.create` (all financial fields)
  - [x] PUT - Update report → `api.reports.update` (with approval workflow)
  - [x] PUT with `estado=aprobado` - Approve report → `api.reports.approve`
  - [x] PUT with `estado=rechazado` - Reject report → `api.reports.reject`
  - [x] DELETE - Delete report → `api.reports.deleteReport`
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (exactOptionalPropertyTypes compliance)
- [x] Use getAuthenticatedConvexClient() for all requests
- [x] Proper error handling via AuthenticationError and ValidationError
- [x] **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Date string → timestamp conversion for `fecha_deposito`
  - [x] Client sends date as "YYYY-MM-DD" string
  - [x] Convert using `Date.parse()` instead of `Number()` (was causing NaN)
  - [x] Validation rejects invalid date strings
  - [x] Applied to both POST (create) and PUT (update) paths

**DEFERRED FEATURES** (to be implemented in subsequent phases):
- ⏳ **Phase 4.10**: File uploads (foto_informe, foto_deposito) - Requires Convex storage integration
- ⏳ **Phase 4.11**: Donor/tither tracking (`report_tithers` table migration)
- ⏳ **Phase 4.12**: Notification system (`report_notifications` table)
- ⏳ **Phase 4.13**: Status history tracking (`report_status_history` table)
- ⏳ **Phase 4.14**: Audit context setting (manual report tracking)

**Result**: Report routes successfully migrated with core CRUD and approval workflow. Simplified from Supabase's complex implementation (file uploads, donor tracking, notifications) while maintaining all essential financial operations. Critical date handling bug fixed during testing. Advanced features documented for future implementation.

### 4.4 Transaction Routes (2h) ✅

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/financial/transactions/route.ts` (simplified from 456 → 247 lines, 46% reduction)
  - [x] GET - List transactions → `api.transactions.list` (with filters: fund_id, church_id, date_from, date_to, month, year)
  - [x] POST - Bulk create transactions → `api.transactions.create` (supports single or array input)
  - [x] PUT - Update transaction → `api.transactions.update` (with automatic balance recalculation)
  - [x] DELETE - Delete transaction → `api.transactions.deleteTransaction` (with balance recalculation)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (no errors in transaction routes)
- [x] Use getAuthenticatedConvexClient() for all requests
- [x] Proper error handling via AuthenticationError and ValidationError
- [x] Date string → timestamp conversion with validation (Date.parse + NaN check)
- [x] Input validation for all endpoints:
  - [x] GET: date_from/date_to (reject NaN), month (1-12), year (2000-2100)
  - [x] POST: date validation for each transaction, amount validation
  - [x] PUT: date validation on updates
- [x] Bulk create support maintained (array or single transaction)
- [x] Balance calculations handled automatically by Convex mutations

**Result**: Transaction routes successfully migrated with full CRUD operations. Simplified from Supabase's complex SQL-based balance tracking to Convex's automatic balance recalculation. All financial integrity maintained through Convex mutations. Input validation prevents NaN/invalid values from reaching Convex.

### 4.5 Fund Routes (1h) ✅

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/financial/funds/route.ts` (simplified from 297 → 182 lines, 39% reduction)
  - [x] GET - List funds → `api.funds.list` (with filters: type, include_inactive)
  - [x] POST - Create fund → `api.funds.create` (with duplicate name check)
  - [x] PUT - Update fund → `api.funds.update` (name, description, type, balance, is_active)
  - [x] DELETE - Archive fund → `api.funds.archive` (soft/hard delete based on transactions)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (no errors in fund routes)
- [x] Use getAuthenticatedConvexClient() for all requests
- [x] Proper error handling via AuthenticationError and ValidationError
- [x] Fund stats (total_in, total_out, transaction_count) calculated by Convex
- [x] Smart delete: soft delete if has transactions, hard delete if empty

**Result**: Fund routes successfully migrated with full CRUD operations. Simplified from Supabase's manual balance tracking to Convex's automatic fund statistics calculation. Smart archive behavior preserves funds with transaction history.

### 4.6 Provider Routes (1h) ✅

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/providers/route.ts`
  - [x] GET - List providers → `api.providers.list` (with pagination and filters)
  - [x] POST - Create provider → `api.providers.create` (with RUC deduplication check)
  - [x] PUT - Update provider → `api.providers.update`
  - [x] DELETE - Archive provider → `api.providers.archive` (soft delete)
- [x] Test RUC deduplication (handled by `searchByRUC` query)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (exactOptionalPropertyTypes compliance)

### 4.7 Admin Routes (2h) ✅

- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` (simplified from 770 → 199 lines, 74% reduction)
  - [x] GET - List users → `api.admin.getUsers` (with filters: church_id, role, active)
  - [x] POST - Create user → `api.admin.createUser` (email, role, church_id, fund_id)
  - [x] PUT - Update user role → `api.admin.updateUserRole` (role, church_id, fund_id)
  - [x] DELETE - Deactivate user → `api.admin.deactivateUser` (soft delete only)
- [x] Migrate `src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts` (simplified from 316 → 51 lines, 84% reduction)

- [x] Email validation with @ipupy.org.py domain restriction
- [x] Removed Supabase Auth sync (Convex uses NextAuth for authentication)
- [x] Hard delete removed (only soft delete/deactivation supported in Convex migration)

**DEFERRED FEATURES** (to be implemented in subsequent phases):
- ⏳ System configuration management (hardcoded defaults in Convex for now)
- ⏳ User activity logging (user_activity table not yet in schema)
- ⏳ Supabase Auth metadata sync (not applicable - using NextAuth)
- ⏳ Rate limiting (to be added in Phase 4.9)
- ⏳ CORS handling (to be standardized in Phase 4.9)

**Result**: Admin routes successfully migrated with massive simplification. Removed Supabase Auth sync complexity (770 → 199 lines for user management, 316 → 51 lines for dashboard). All core admin functionality maintained: user CRUD, role management, dashboard statistics. Advanced features (config management, audit logging) documented for future implementation.

### 4.8 Auth Routes (1h) ✅

**NOTE**: Authentication already migrated in Phase 4.1b (NextAuth v5 → Convex OIDC Bridge)

- [x] Keep existing NextAuth routes (already implemented in Phase 4.1b)
  - [x] `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth handler
  - [x] `src/app/api/openid/token/route.ts` - ID token endpoint for Convex
  - [x] `src/app/api/openid/refresh/route.ts` - Token refresh endpoint
- [x] Remove Supabase Auth callback route
  - [x] Archive `src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` (Supabase legacy)
- [x] No additional changes needed - auth fully functional

**Result**: Auth routes complete. NextAuth provides Google OAuth with domain validation (@ipupy.org.py). Convex validates Google OIDC tokens. Supabase Auth callback route archived.

### 4.9 Testing & Validation (1h)

**NOTE**: Deferred to Phase 7 (comprehensive testing phase)

- [ ] Test all API routes with different user roles (Phase 7)
- [ ] Verify error handling and validation (Phase 7)

## ⏳ Phase 5: Frontend Integration (PENDING)

**Duration**: 8-10 hours  
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Objectives & Guardrails

- Preserve the existing DTO/normalizer contract so React components remain untouched where possible.
- Re-use the Convex auth bridge from Phase 4 (NextAuth-issued Google ID token) for both client and server renders, matching the architecture guidance in *Arquitectura propuesta (Next.js 15 + Vercel + Convex).md*.
- Replace TanStack Query incrementally to avoid a “flag day” cut-over; keep user-facing features working throughout the migration.
- Leverage Convex’s real-time updates and optimistic mutations instead of duplicating cache logic in the app layer.

### 5.0 Preflight & Inventory (0.5h)

- [ ] Audit existing data hooks (`src/hooks/**`) and note which still depend on `@tanstack/react-query`, `fetchJson`, or REST endpoints.
- [ ] Document mutation side-effects (toast notifications, query invalidations) so we can re-create equivalent behavior with Convex React helpers.
- [ ] Confirm Convex codegen (`npx convex codegen`) is up to date to supply typed APIs for the frontend.

### 5.1 Shared Infrastructure & Providers (1h)

- [x] Install/verify `convex`, `convex/react`, and ensure no duplicate versions in `package.json`.
- [x] Update `src/app/providers.tsx` to instantiate a singleton `ConvexReactClient` and wrap the tree with `ConvexProviderWithAuth` using the existing `useAuthFromNextAuth` hook (per architecture doc §1).
- [x] Ensure `src/app/layout.tsx` composes the updated provider stack (NextAuth SessionProvider → ConvexProvider → UI theme providers, etc.).
- [x] Add a lightweight health check component (e.g., `ConvexConnectionBoundary`) to surface authentication or network issues during development.

### 5.2 Adapter Layer & Utilities (1h)

- [x] Introduce a `src/lib/convex-adapters.ts` module that wraps common Convex queries/mutations to maintain the existing normalized data shapes (e.g., map Convex fund documents to `RawFundRecord`).
- [x] Centralize helpers for converting Convex timestamps/IDs to the legacy contracts to keep React components unchanged.
- [x] Provide a thin wrapper `useConvexMutation` that adds toast/error handling parity with the current `fetchJson` helpers.
- [x] Added `useConvexQueryState` utility to mirror TanStack-style status flags while subscribing to Convex reactivity.

### 5.3 Migration Wave A – Read-mostly Hooks (1.5h)

- [ ] Convert low-risk, read-only hooks to use `useQuery(api.*)` through the adapter layer.
  - [x] `useChurches`
  - [x] `useFunds`
  - [x] `useAdminChurches`
  - [x] `useAdminFunds`
  - [ ] `useAdminData` dashboard stats helper (remaining reconciliation/report summaries)
    - [x] `useAdminReports`
    - [ ] `useAdminReconciliation` (blocked until backend reconciliation metrics exist)
- [ ] Remove related REST fetches once each hook is verified against Convex responses.
- [ ] Validate dependent pages (dashboard, fund selectors, dropdowns) for loading/empty states.

### 5.4 Migration Wave B – Core Transactional Hooks (2.5h)

- [ ] Migrate `useReports`, `useReport`, `useReportMutations` to Convex queries/mutations, re-implement optimistic workflows using Convex mutation return values.
  - [x] `useReports`
  - [x] `useLastReport`
  - [x] `useReport`
  - [x] `useReportMutations`
- [x] Port `useFundEvents`, `useFundEvent` family to consume Convex event APIs now that Phase 4 stabilized the contracts.
- [ ] Update transaction and movement hooks ensuring pagination/filter args align with Convex functions.
  - [x] `useTransactions`
  - [x] `useFundMovements`
- [ ] Smoke-test create/update/approve flows end-to-end for funds, reports, and events.

### 5.5 Migration Wave C – Admin & Cross-cutting Hooks (1.5h)

- [ ] Refactor `useAdminData`, user management hooks, and system configuration fetchers to Convex.
- [ ] Update any remaining legacy helpers (e.g., provider search, reconciliation data) to point at Convex queries.
- [ ] Ensure access control checks surface meaningful errors in the UI when Convex denies a mutation.

### 5.6 Dependency Cleanup (0.5h)

- [ ] Remove `@tanstack/react-query` and associated utilities (`QueryClient`, `fetchJson`, query invalidation helpers) once all hooks are on Convex.
- [ ] Drop obsolete API route utilities that only served the REST layer.
- [ ] Confirm bundler/analyzers show the Convex client as the sole data source.

### 5.7 Observability & Offline Behavior (0.5h)

- [ ] Add log instrumentation (optional dev-only) to capture Convex query timing for critical screens.
- [ ] Verify Convex’s built-in offline queueing for mutations does not conflict with existing UI disablement logic; adjust buttons/spinners as needed.

### 5.8 QA & Sign-off (1h)

- [ ] Regression-test all major user journeys (login → dashboard, monthly report lifecycle, fund event workflow, admin management).
- [ ] Validate real-time updates by opening parallel sessions.
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and relevant smoke scripts to ensure no regressions prior to tagging Phase 5 complete.

### Deliverables

- [ ] Convex provider infrastructure wired per architecture guide.
- [ ] All data hooks powered by Convex queries/mutations with preserved DTO contracts.
- [ ] TanStack Query (and related REST plumbing) removed from the codebase.
- [ ] Updated documentation for frontend data access patterns.
- [ ] QA checklist demonstrating core flows on Convex.

### Current Assessment (2025-10-08)

- Every hook under `src/hooks/` still imports `@tanstack/react-query` and the shared `fetchJson` wrapper. No partial migrations have occurred yet, so we can plan the cut-over holistically.
- `src/app/providers.tsx` already wraps the app with `ConvexProviderWithAuth` (NextAuth bridge) but still instantiates `QueryClientProvider`. We can phase out the Query Client once hook migrations land.
- `convex` and `convex/react` are already present in `package.json`; no dependency installation is required before Phase 5 implementation.

## Rollback Plan

**If issues occur in production:**

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour)

1. Revert Vercel deployment to previous version
   ```bash
   # Get previous deployment
   vercel ls
   # Promote previous deployment
   vercel promote <previous-deployment-url>
   ```

2. Restore Supabase environment variables in Vercel
   - Re-enable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`

### Data Sync Issues

If data is out of sync:
1. Keep new data in Convex (recent changes)
2. Export from Supabase (baseline)
3. Merge carefully
4. Re-run migration with merged data

## Migration Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | HIGH | LOW | Multiple backups, validation scripts |
| Authorization bugs | HIGH | MEDIUM | Comprehensive role testing |
| Performance degradation | MEDIUM | LOW | Performance testing before production |
| User confusion | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Keep UI identical, document changes |
| Convex service issues | HIGH | LOW | Keep Supabase as fallback for 2 weeks |
| Real-time features break | MEDIUM | LOW | Test thoroughly, Convex has built-in reactivity |

## Notes & Decisions

### 2025-01-07
- ✅ Completed Phase 1 (Convex Setup)
- ✅ Completed Phase 2 (Data Migration)
  - Successfully migrated 1,977 records
  - 100% foreign key resolution
  - Zero migration errors
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.1 (Setup & Utilities)
  - Created auth utilities (auth.ts, permissions.ts, errors.ts, validators.ts)
  - Cleaned up temporary fields from schema
  - Added fund_id to profiles for fund_director role
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.2 (Churches Module)
  - Created convex/churches.ts with 5 queries and 3 mutations
  - Implemented full authorization (admin-only mutations, church-scoped queries)
  - Tested schema deployment (successful)
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.3 (Reports Module)
  - Created convex/reports.ts (largest module: 6 queries + 6 mutations)
  - Implemented complete financial calculation logic (fondo_nacional, honorarios_pastoral, etc.)
  - Added approval workflow (pendiente → enviado → aprobado/rechazado)
  - Bank deposit validation with tolerance (₲100)
  - All 78 report columns supported
  - Transaction creation marked as TODO for Phase 3.4
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.4 (Transactions Module)
  - Created convex/transactions.ts (6 queries + 4 mutations)
  - Implemented double-entry bookkeeping with automatic balance tracking
  - Running balance calculation for ledger views
  - Complete CRUD operations with balance recalculation on delete
  - Fund directors blocked from write operations (read-only access)
  - BulkCreate mutation for automatic transaction generation from reports
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.5 (Funds Module)
  - Created convex/funds.ts (5 queries + 4 mutations)
  - Transaction stats calculation (total_in, total_out, count)
  - Smart soft/hard delete based on transaction existence
  - getOrCreate helper for fund auto-creation during imports
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.6 (Providers Module)
  - Created convex/providers.ts (4 queries + 3 mutations)
  - RUC deduplication validation (case-insensitive)
  - Transaction usage tracking for each provider
  - Search with partial matching (name, RUC, razon_social)
  - Soft delete only (prevents deletion if used in transactions)
- ✅ Completed Phase 3.7 (Admin Module) ✨
  - Created convex/admin.ts (4 queries + 5 mutations)
  - System configuration with live fund/role enrichment
  - Dashboard stats (churches, reports, fund balances)
  - User management (CRUD) with church/fund assignment
  - Audit logging helper (console.log placeholder for user_activity table)
  - Admin-only authorization via requireAdmin()
  - Email domain validation (@ipupy.org.py)
- 🎉 **PHASE 3 COMPLETE** - All 7 core modules migrated to Convex!
- 📝 Decision: Use church names as stable identifiers (instead of numeric IDs)
- 📝 Decision: Keep file uploads in Supabase Storage (for now, migrate later if needed)
- 📝 Decision: Simplified churches module (removed pastor JOIN, using flat structure)
- 📝 Decision: Reports module uses helper function `calculateReportTotals()` for all financial calculations
- 📝 Decision: Removed donor tracking from initial reports migration (can add later if needed)
- 📝 Decision: Transactions module simplified (removed fund_movements_enhanced table, use transaction.balance field)
- 📝 Decision: Balance integrity via recalculation from scratch on delete operations
- 📝 Decision: Providers module enforces RUC uniqueness for centralized registry (migration 027)
- 📝 Decision: Admin module uses console logging for audit trail (user_activity table deferred to schema update)
- 📝 Decision: System config returns default values + live fund data (system_configuration table deferred)
- 🔄 Next: Phase 4 (API Routes Migration) - Replace Supabase routes with Convex function calls
