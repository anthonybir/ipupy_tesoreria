# Future Improvements Backlog

_Last updated: 2025-10-06_

This directory collects forward-looking proposals that are not yet scheduled. Move items out of this folder once they transition into an active roadmap (`docs/project-status/`) or a formal feature specification (`docs/features/`).

| Document | Description | Status | Next Step |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `ACCESSIBILITY_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` | Comprehensive plan to deliver WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. | ðŸŸ¡ Proposed | Scope final design and identify engineering owner before execution. |
| `MIGRATE_TO_SUPABASE_CLIENT.md` | Outline for moving to the latest Supabase client libraries. | ðŸŸ¡ Proposed | Validate SDK compatibility and estimate migration complexity. |

### Contribution Notes

- Add a **Last Updated** line at the top of new proposals.
- Use action-oriented filenames (e.g., `IMPROVE_DATA_EXPORT.md`).
- Link back to this README when referencing planned work from status reports.

Once an initiative is funded or scheduled, copy the document to the appropriate destination and replace the entry with a short note linking to its new home.
