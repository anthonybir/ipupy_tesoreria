# CRITICAL FIX: Permissions Matrix Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Audit/Security Issue
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔴 Problem Description

The permissions matrix in `docs/ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md:475` contained **incorrect permissions** that contradicted the actual system implementation. This created a high-severity audit risk where:

1. **Security audits would be incorrect** - Based on documentation showing elevated permissions that don't exist
2. **Developers could reintroduce bugs** - Attempting to "fix" perceived gaps by granting permissions that were intentionally removed
3. **Compliance violations** - Documented permissions exceeded actual implementation

---

## 📊 Incorrect Permissions Documented

### Treasurer Role (Church-Level)
**Documented (WRONG)**:
- ✅ `events.manage` ❌
- ✅ `events.create` ❌
- ✅ `events.approve` ❌
- ✅ `dashboard.view` ❌

**Actual Implementation** (`admin/configuration/page.tsx:226`):
```typescript
{
  id: 'treasurer',
  name: 'Tesorero de Iglesia',
  permissions: [
    'funds.view',
    'reports.create',
    'reports.edit',
    'transactions.create',
    'transactions.view'
  ]
}
```

**Why Wrong**: Migration 038 explicitly removed event permissions from church-level roles because **events are NATIONAL-level only** (fund directors manage national fund events).

---

### Secretary Role (Church-Level)
**Documented (WRONG)**:
- ✅ `events.manage` ❌
- ✅ `dashboard.view` ❌

**Actual Implementation** (`admin/configuration/page.tsx:239`):
```typescript
{
  id: 'secretary',
  name: 'Secretario',
  permissions: [
    'members.manage',
    'reports.view'
  ]
}
```

**Why Wrong**: Migration 038:74 explicitly deleted `events.manage` from secretary:
```sql
DELETE FROM role_permissions
WHERE role = 'secretary'
AND permission = 'events.manage';

RAISE NOTICE '✓ Removed event permissions from secretary (secretary is church-level support)';
```

---

### Church Manager Role
**Documented (WRONG)**:
- ❌ `members.view` (missing)
- ❌ `dashboard.view` (missing)
- ❌ `church.view` (missing)

**Actual Implementation** (`admin/configuration/page.tsx:232`):
```typescript
{
  id: 'church_manager',
  name: 'Gerente de Iglesia',
  permissions: [
    'church.view',
    'dashboard.view',
    'events.view',
    'members.view',
    'reports.view'
  ]
}
```

**Why Wrong**: Documentation understated permissions, missing 3 critical view permissions.

## ✅ Corrected Matrix

### Complete Corrected Permissions by Role

#### Admin (7 permissions in default config)
- `system.manage`, `users.manage`, `churches.manage`, `reports.approve`, `funds.manage`, `events.*` (all event permissions)

#### National Treasurer (11 permissions)
- `events.approve`, `events.view`, `events.edit`, `events.create`
- `funds.view`, `funds.manage`
- `transactions.view`, `transactions.create`
- `dashboard.view`, `churches.view`, `reports.view`

#### Fund Director (10 permissions)
- `events.create`, `events.edit`, `events.submit`, `events.view`, `events.actuals`
- `funds.view`, `transactions.view`
- `dashboard.view`, `churches.view`, `reports.view`

#### Pastor (5 permissions)
- `church.manage`, `funds.view`, `members.manage`, `reports.create`, `reports.edit`

#### Treasurer (5 permissions) ✅ CORRECTED
- `funds.view`
- `reports.create`, `reports.edit`
- `transactions.create`, `transactions.view`
- **NO event permissions** (events are national-level)
- **NO dashboard.view** (church-level only)

#### Church Manager (5 permissions) ✅ CORRECTED
- `church.view` ✅ (was missing)
- `dashboard.view` ✅ (was missing)
- `events.view`
- `members.view` ✅ (was missing)
- `reports.view`

#### Secretary (2 permissions) ✅ CORRECTED
- `members.manage`
- `reports.view`
- **NO events.manage** (removed in migration 038)
- **NO dashboard.view** (church-level only)

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why the Errors Occurred

1. **Documentation lag**: ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md was not updated when migration 038 removed church-level event permissions
2. **Manual maintenance**: Matrix was manually maintained instead of being derived from code
3. **No validation**: No automated check to verify documentation matches implementation

### Business Logic Clarification

**CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE** (from migration 038 comments):
- **Events are NATIONAL-LEVEL ONLY**
- **Church roles DO NOT manage events**
- Only these roles can manage events:
  - `admin` (all events)
  - `national_treasurer` (all events - approve/reject)
  - `fund_director` (assigned fund events - create/edit/submit)

Church roles (pastor, treasurer, church_manager, secretary) manage:
- Monthly financial **reports** (church-level)
- **Members** (church-level)
- **Transactions** (church-level, treasurer only)

## 🛡️ Security Implications

### Audit Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Granting unintended permissions during "fixes" | 🔴 HIGH | Matrix corrected, added source-of-truth warning |
| Incorrect security audits | 🔴 HIGH | Matrix now matches code exactly |
| Compliance violations (over-documenting access) | 🟡 MEDIUM | Corrected to actual implementation |
| Developer confusion | 🟡 MEDIUM | Added explicit notes about event scope |

### What Could Have Gone Wrong

**Scenario 1**: Security audit reads documentation
- Auditor: "Treasurer can approve events"
- Reality: Treasurer cannot (events are national-level)
- **Result**: False positive in audit, wasted time investigating

**Scenario 2**: Developer "fixes" perceived missing permission
```typescript
// Developer sees docs showing treasurer.events.approve
// Adds permission thinking it's a bug
{
  id: 'treasurer',
  permissions: [..., 'events.approve'] // ❌ WRONG - violates business logic
}
```
- **Result**: Church-level users could approve national fund events (security breach)

**Scenario 3**: Compliance review
- Document states elevated permissions
- Actual system has restricted permissions
- **Result**: Compliance team flags "undocumented permission restriction"

## ✅ Corrections Applied

### 1. Updated Permissions Matrix (`ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`)

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed `events.manage`, `events.create`, `events.approve` from treasurer
- ❌ Removed `dashboard.view` from treasurer
- ❌ Removed `events.manage` from secretary
- ❌ Removed `dashboard.view` from secretary
- ✅ Added `church.view` to church_manager
- ✅ Added `dashboard.view` to church_manager
- ✅ Added `members.view` to church_manager
- ✅ Added explicit note: "Eventos (SOLO NACIONAL - NO iglesias)"
- ✅ Added source-of-truth disclaimer pointing to code

### 2. Added Source-of-Truth Section

```markdown
### ⚠️ FUENTE DE VERDAD (Source of Truth)

Esta matriz se mantiene sincronizada con:
1. **src/app/admin/configuration/page.tsx** - defaultRolesConfig (UI)
2. **migrations/038_fix_permissions_correctly.sql** - Eliminaciones explícitas
3. **migrations/039_add_fund_director_view_permissions.sql** - fund_director permisos
4. **migrations/040_add_national_treasurer_role.sql** - national_treasurer permisos

**CRÍTICO**: Si hay discrepancias entre esta matriz y el código, el CÓDIGO es la fuente de verdad.
```

### 3. Updated Scope Legend

```markdown
### Leyenda de Alcance
- **all**: Todas las iglesias/datos del sistema
- **assigned**: Solo fondos/iglesias asignados al usuario
- **own**: Solo su iglesia/datos propios
```

Added `assigned` scope to clarify fund_director restrictions.

## 🎯 Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ Documentation showed 8 incorrect permissions across 3 roles
- ❌ Treasurer appeared to have event management capabilities (wrong)
- ❌ Church_manager appeared to lack view permissions (wrong)
- ❌ No clear source-of-truth guidance
- 🔴 HIGH audit risk

### After Fix
- ✅ All permissions match actual implementation
- ✅ Clear business logic documented (events = national only)
- ✅ Source-of-truth section added
- ✅ Scope clarified (all/assigned/own)
- ✅ Zero discrepancies
- ✅ Audit-ready documentation

## 🔄 Future Prevention

### Recommendations

1. **Automated Validation**:
   ```typescript
   // Consider adding a test that compares documentation to code
   test('permissions matrix matches defaultRolesConfig', () => {
     // Parse ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md matrix
     // Compare to defaultRolesConfig
     // Fail if discrepancies
   });
   ```

2. **Code-First Documentation**:
   - Consider generating permissions matrix from `defaultRolesConfig`
   - Use TypeScript to ensure docs stay in sync

3. **Migration Review Checklist**:
   - [ ] Update `admin/configuration/page.tsx`
   - [ ] Update migration SQL
   - [ ] Update `ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md` matrix
   - [ ] Update `USER_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` if needed

4. **Source of Truth Hierarchy**:
   1. **Code** (`admin/configuration/page.tsx`)
   2. **Database** (migration files)
   3. **Documentation** (updated from 1 & 2)
