# CHANGELOG

## [3.0.1] - 2025-09-25

### Treasury Admin Enhancements & Reconciliation

#### ‚ú® Features
- **Manual Report Entry for Treasurers**: Admins can capture paper/WhatsApp submissions with full donor breakdown, source tracking, and automatic status `pendiente_admin`.
- **Libro Mensual Command Center**: Three coordinated tabs (Procesar informes, Transacciones externas, Conciliaci√≥n) streamline approvals, external postings, and balance audits.
- **Enhanced Reconciliation Dashboard**: Fund discrepancies vs. ledger are surfaced with status tags, last-movement metadata, and fund filters.

#### üîß Fixes & Improvements
- **Fund Balance Reset**: Added December 31, 2024 reconciliation transactions aligning all national funds with the official saldos (Gs. 18.840.572 net).
- **RLS-safe Admin Queries**: Libro Mensual and admin endpoints fetch data via the pooled connection, ensuring legacy imports remain visible to treasury roles.
- **Validation Parity**: Manual reports now enforce aportante identity + amount checks matching the pastor portal, preventing orphaned diezmo totals.

#### üìö Documentation
- Updated developer, API, and user guides to cover the manual workflow, donor requirements, reconciliation steps, and new schema fields (`submission_source`, `manual_report_*`, `entered_*`).

This release introduces comprehensive treasury management capabilities with proper fund allocation, donor tracking, and financial reporting aligned with IPU Paraguay's official processes.

---

## üéØ Core Features Implemented

### 1. Three-Step Monthly Workflow System
Complete implementation of the treasurer's monthly workflow:
- **Step 1: Worship Records** - Record all church services with attendance and contributions
- **Step 2: Expense Records** - Track all church expenses and generate pastor invoices
- **Step 3: Monthly Summary** - Review, balance, and close the monthly period

### 2. Permanent Donor Registry System
- Centralized donor management per church
- Automatic donor creation and matching
- CI/RUC validation and duplicate prevention
- Donor autocomplete in contribution forms
- Historical donor tracking across months

### 3. National Fund Allocation System
Implemented correct fund distribution rules matching official IPU Paraguay forms:
- **10% to National Fund**: Tithes (Diezmos) and Regular Offerings (Ofrendas)
- **100% to National Fund**: Special Mission Funds
  - Misiones (Mission Offerings)
  - Lazos de Amor (Love Bonds)
  - Misi√≥n Posible (Mission Possible)
  - APY (Pentecostal Youth Association)
  - Instituto B√≠blico (Bible Institute)
  - Diezmo Pastoral (Pastoral Tithe)
  - Caballeros (Men's Ministry - when designated for national)
- **100% Local**: Church-designated funds (Damas, J√≥venes, Ni√±os, Anexos, Otros)

National treasury now receives detailed transactions per fund instead of aggregated amounts:
- Separate transactions for General Fund (10% allocations)
- Individual transactions for each special fund (APY, Misiones, etc.)

- Balance tracking per national fund

## üîç Key Business Logic Changes

### Fund Allocation Rules (CRITICAL)
Previous system allocated 10% of ALL income to national fund. New system correctly implements:

```javascript
// Before (INCORRECT):
National Fund = Total Income * 0.10

// After (CORRECT):
National Fund = (Tithes + Offerings) * 0.10 + Special_Funds * 1.00
Local Funds = (Tithes + Offerings) * 0.90 + Local_Designated_Funds
```

### Transaction Generation
```javascript
// Before: Single aggregated transaction
INSERT INTO transactions (fund: "Fondo Nacional", amount: 1,200,000)

// After: Individual fund transactions
INSERT INTO transactions (fund: "General", amount: 1,100,000)  // 10% of tithes/offerings
INSERT INTO transactions (fund: "Misiones", amount: 50,000)    // 100% of missions
INSERT INTO transactions (fund: "APY", amount: 50,000)         // 100% of APY
```

### Pastoral Salary Calculation
```javascript
// Automatic calculation
Pastoral Salary = Local Available Funds - Total Expenses

// Zero-balance enforcement
Month Balance = Local Funds - Expenses - Pastoral Salary = 0
```
